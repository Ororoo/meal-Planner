The Meal Planner App is designed to be a user-friendly tool that helps individuals make informed decisions about their daily meals. 
The app will provide personalized meal plans based on user input, taking into consideration factors such as age, weight, height, and gender.
A unique feature of the app is its daily variability â€“ users select the current day (Monday, Tuesday, etc..) and meal (breakfast, lunch, or dinner), 
and a specific meal plan is generated and displayed. The app aims to make meal planning intuitive and tailored to each user's goals and preferences.
It is a web application app designed using Flask and still under development.

Requirements:
**# from flask import Flask
**# import pymysql.cursors
**# import pymysql 
**# import mysql.connector
